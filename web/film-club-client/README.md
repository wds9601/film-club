## This FrontEnd Built With
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Grommet.io](https://v2.grommet.io/)


## Why make this?
I am a recent bootcamp grad developer looking to broaden my experience with different front-end technologies and learn team-development practices with industry professionals as I hunt for a job.  This project allowed me to join forces with [gstro](https://github.com/gstro) who took on building out the backend.  

I learn a ton every week as we progress through the app and gstro shares tips for better development.  Here are some of the things I have learned/had exposure to so far:

- Github's amazing project management tools
- Properly using Git branching and PR's for descriptive project history
- Using a proxy to get around CORS issues in development
- Learning to use a new design framework with Grommet
- Learn how to use SwaggerHub/OpenAPI collaboration tools
